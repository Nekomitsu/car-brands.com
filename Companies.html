                        <h1>Top Car Sales and Manufacturer </h1>
                        <p>Toyota was the #1 automaker worldwide for the 2nd year in a row for 2021.Chinese automaker, Changan, had the strongest year-over-year performance, up 15% worldwide. Tesla had tremendous gains, up 87% worldwide, but fell short of 1 million units and did not make our top 15 list in 2021.As supply deficiencies settle, it becomes ever clearer that a swift rebound followed by a gradual increase into new EV markets will emerge and be led by the manufacturers brave enough to ally with global rivals.</p>
                        <p>Choosing the right vehicle can be tough, since buyers have to choose from more than 35 brands that sell cars, trucks, and SUVs in the U.S. Sure, there are some brand loyalists out there who are committed to buying a Toyota or Honda, for example, but most consumers consider multiple options from several automakers before coming to a decision.With car brands continually being introduced, redesigned, and discontinued in the U.S. market, it’s no wonder consumers can get confused about where the top quality lies in each class. However, we’re here to help you through this daunting process. Our Best Vehicle Brand Awards cut through the swath of new and old makes (plus all the marketing jargon) to highlight the brands that shine in the areas that matter to you. The awards honor the best brands for cars, SUVs, luxury vehicles, and trucks. Keep reading to learn which brands should top your shopping list. </p>
